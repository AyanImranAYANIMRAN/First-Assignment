            Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It is made by
            layering marinated meat (or vegetables) and partially cooked rice, then cooking them together to allow the
            flavors to meld. The dish is often infused with spices such as saffron, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and bay
            leaves. Biryani is typically served with raita (yogurt sauce), salad, and sometimes a boiled egg or fried
            onions as a garnish.
