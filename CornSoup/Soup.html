            Corn soup is a popular and comforting dish made primarily from corn, often combined with a variety of
            ingredients to enhance its flavor and texture. In Pakistani cuisine, corn soup is typically enjoyed as a
            starter or light meal, especially during the colder months. The base is usually made from sweet corn
            kernels, either fresh, frozen, or canned, and the soup is often thickened with corn flour or blended corn.
            It is seasoned with spices and herbs to create a savory and satisfying dish.
