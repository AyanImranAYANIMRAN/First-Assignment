        <dd>Pizza is a popular dish that originated from Italy, traditionally consisting of a round, flat base of
            leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients. It is baked at a
            high temperature, typically in a wood-fired oven. Over the years, pizza has evolved and adapted to various
            cultures, resulting in a multitude of styles and flavors. In Pakistan, pizza has become a beloved food item
            with local twists to suit regional tastes.
